# LANotation

A repository to create and improve notation for Legacy's Allure games

---

[Lagacy's Allure](https://legacysallure.com/) is a customisable, card-based war game, played on a hexagonal grid. This project aims to create and develop a form of recording notation for games, to allow users to create a record of their games, replay them, analyse their moves, and more. The repo also includes a series of games, all anonymised, that demonstrate the notation.
